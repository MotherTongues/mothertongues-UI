        Verna DeMontigny was born in her parents’ home at Fort Ellice
        Municipality, Manitoba in a small Metis community known as Fouillard’s
        Corner. Fouillard’s Corner, although it no longer exists, was located
        7.5 miles west of Binscarth, Manitoba. Verna’s parents relocated there
        from Ste Madeleine, MB in 1939 when the PFRA put in a community pasture
        for cows.

        Brandon, MB. Here in Brandon, MB she started a small housecleaning
        business and at the same time worked as a leather seamstress at Fleece
        Line Ventures.

        Manitoba Métis Federation and worked there as a Bingo and Canteen
        worker. She also worked at Southwest Daycare as cook/cleaner and
        Childcare Worker for many years. After regretfully retiring from
        Southwest Daycare, she went on to work as a Membership/Harvesting Clerk
        at Manitoba Métis Federation.

        places, through a variety of organizations that had projects to teach
        her Michif language. She has over the years attended many Language

        related events throughout the Southwest Region. As time gives her
        experience, she shares her knowledge with all.

        Verna DeMontigny, born 1951, has preserved the knowledge and ancestral
        Language that was passed on to her from her parents and ancestors. She
        has experienced many changes, from being raised in a small Métis
        Community, living in a log cabin, living the traditional way of life,
        raising her family as a single parent, going back to school after 32
        years and working tirelessly to preserve the Oral teachings and Language
        that was handed down to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verna believes that language and traditional practices are the
        Cornerstones of The Metis Culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has shown a stunning example of how adaptability, persistence and
        strong willpower are tools for success.
