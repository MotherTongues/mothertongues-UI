    While Michif language learning and teaching continues to expand, access to
    language resource materials is often limited. Working with community
    members, linguists and other specialists, our response has been to create a
    digital edition of the The Michif Dictionary Turtle Mountain Chippewa Cree
    by first language speakers Ida Rose Allard and Patline Laverdure and
    linguist John Crawford. Not only have we reproduced the
    <a routerLink="/introduction"
      >textual contents of the original publication</a
    >, but we have also added fluent speakersâ€™ audio recordings of all Michif
    entries and example sentences.

    The <a class="guide" (click)="openPronunciation()">writing system</a> used
    in this version of the Michif Talking Dictionary is the one used in the
    original print dictionary and also reflects the variation between the two
    different speakers and their own spelling conventions. However, having
    multiple spellings for the same sounds can sometimes be confusing for
    learners. We are, therefore, working to have the Michif Talking Dictionary
    available in the Michif Double Vowel writing system (a work in progress!) as
    well, which is what is used in the Southern Michif

    We hope you find this resource supports your Michif learning wherever you
    are on your journey.
