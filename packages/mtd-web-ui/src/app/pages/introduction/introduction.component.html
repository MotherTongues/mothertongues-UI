  <p class="c109">
    <span class="c2">A title as complicated as </span
    ><span class="c42 c79 c8"
      >The Michif Dictionary: Turtle Mountain Chip&shy;pewa Cree </span
    ><span class="c2"
      >merits explanation. The label &#39;Chippewa&#39; is used because the
      language reported here is part of the linguistic heritage of the Chippewa
      of the Turtle Mountain Reservation of North Dakota. The language of the
      dictionary is not Chippewa, but rather a mixture of French and Cree, </span
    ><span class="c31">albeit</span
    ><span class="c2"
      >&nbsp;with some Chippewa influence, and is so appropriately labelled
      &#39;the Cree language of the Turtle Mountain Reservation&#39;. It is also
      appropriate that it have another label, &#39;Michif&#39;, because the
      combination of Cree and French developed under special cultural influences
      that produced a population neither clearly Indian nor Euro&shy;pean, to
      which the label &#39;Metis&#39; has been applied since early in the
      history of Canada, and continues to be applied. It can easily be affirmed
      that the language of this dictionary is part of the Metis movement, of
      language in the Metis tradition. And, although the label does not find
      universal approval, Metis people somewhat closer to Indian than European
      sources have frequent&shy;ly be</span
    ><span class="c31">e</span
    ><span class="c2"
      >n called &#39;Michif&#39;, and speakers of the language reported here
      frequently call themselves and the language by that name. Others prefer
      the label &#39;French&shy; Cree&#39;.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c115">
    <span class="c2"
      >In many ways &#39;Michif&#39; is the most appropriate term. &#39;Turtle
      Mountain Cree&#39; or &#39;Turtle Mountain Chippewa Cree&#39; give the
      implication that the language is peculiar to the reservation, when in fact
      most of the linguistic characters reported here are shared with people
      spread over quite a large area of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
      &#39;Michif&#39; has the advantage over &#39;French-Cree&#39; in that it
      is a term used by members of the society, although frequently with
      negative connotations, whereas &#39;French-Cree&#39; is an analytic term
      and basically a product of the academic labelling society. Thus the term
      is important to the title. Nonetheless, because the data presented here
      are in fact directly represen&shy;tative of only the situation on the
      Turtle Mountain Reservation, and many choices, like for instance those
      affecting orthographic conventions, have been made because of
      sociolinguistic characteristics of the North Dakota context and would
      almost certainly be different if the dictionary primarily reported the
      Canadian situation. So the long title: </span
    ><span class="c42 c79 c8"
      >The Michif Dictionary: Turtle Mountain Chippewa Cree.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c95">
    <span class="c2"
      >Since it has already been stated that this dictionary does not deal with
      the Chippewa language, a little more clarification is necessary. Michif is
      only one part of the linguistic heritage of the reservation. Chippewa or
      Ojibwa or Saulteaux, which may be taken as synonyms in this context, is a
      definite part.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c35">
    <span class="c2"
      >It is the language of the parents and grandparents of many if not most
      members of the tribe and continues to be spoken by some. The language and
      its relationship to the reservation are of importance. That this effort is
      directed towards Michif should not be taken as implying that the Ojibwa
      language as spoken is not an important object of study. The justifications
      of studying Michif are positive and have nothing to do with a negative
      judgement of the importance of Ojibwa.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c69">
    <span class="c2"
      >One of the reasons why it is important to direct special attention to
      Michif is that there are strongly established attitudes toward products of
      language con&shy;tact, languages that develop out of contact between other
      languages, that tend to diminish them in the eyes of their speakers. Thus,
      in reference to Michif, it is common to hear that it is only a haphazard
      mix-up of several languages and therefore has no validity in itself, that
      no two people speak it the same, that it represents a corruption or
      deterioration of languages. Some of this disrespect is of the same origin
      and is sustained by the same factors that have given &#39;half&shy;
      breeds&#39; and Metis less respect than either whites or Indians. An
      observation of the available evidence shows that far from being a random
      mixture of elements from a lot of languages-French, Chippewa, Cree,
      English, Gaelic, Assini&shy;boine, etc.-Michif is dominated by two, French
      and Cree, and in a pattern of combination which is most unusual and in its
      way very rigorous. The structure of the noun phrase, names of things and
      the words which go with them, is clearly French, even to preserving French
      gender and the rules of sound com&shy;bination, whereas verbs in Michif
      show the range and complexity of affixation&middot; that characterizes
      Algonquian languages, and which are in fact, Plains Cree. There are many
      areas in which there is openness as to the amount of French used, and the
      patterns of syntactic organization are probably best looked at as Cree but
      with important influence from French. Nevertheless the overall
      pat&shy;terning of the language is anything but haphazard; Michif is a
      very specific sort of combination of languages.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c66">
    <span class="c2"
      >There is, to be sure, a fair amount of English in the mixture. The way in
      which these are absorbed, however, illustrates the predominance of the
      French component, since English words are usually given French articles
      and gender. Thus in story text, words like </span
    ><span class="c42 c79 c8">en pchit lamp </span
    ><span class="c2">&#39;a little lamp&#39;, </span
    ><span class="c42 c79 c8">aen yeast cake </span
    ><span class="c2">&#39;a yeast cake&#39;, </span
    ><span class="c42 c8 c79">daw </span><span class="c26">l</span
    ><span class="c15">i </span><span class="c42 c79 c8">store </span
    ><span class="c2">&#39;in the store,&#39; are typical.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c63">
    <span class="c2"
      >It is true that there is quite a lot of dialect variation shown by
      speakers of Michif, so that when the language has been taught on the
      reservation, there has been some complaint that it was not being taught
      correctly, that is, not ac&shy;cording to the way it was spoken in the
      home of the student. Yet the very in&shy;sistence on this correctness is
      support</span
    ><span class="c31">&nbsp;</span
    ><span class="c2"
      >to the notion that there is a common ground of agreement in the dialect
      variation, and study so far shows that this dialect variation, although
      appreciable, is not greater than that shown within many language groups.
      Quite a lot of it has to do with fairly regular sound processes, so that
      where some speakers have an &#39;h&#39; sound, others use &#39;s&#39;.
      Other major dimensions of difference are in the amount of French used
      outside of just the nouns, and certain differences in Cree grammatical
      markings.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c93">
    <span class="c2"
      >Much more remarkable than the dialect differences that exist on the
      reserva&shy;tion is the consistency that Michif shows in a wide variety of
      locales, so that speakers interviewed in St. Lazare, San Clara, St.
      Laurent in Manitoba and Ft. Qu&#39;appelle, Saskatchewan show, at least on
      preliminary examination, remarkable agreement not only in vocabulary and
      syntax, but even in the voice melody or intonational patterns used.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c16">
    <span class="c2"
      >A further kind of evidence for the importance of Michif is seen in
      socio&shy;linguistic evidence. It has become the most important local
      language, from the standpoint of the number of persons speaking it and
      patterns of authority on the reservation. In a survey of homes conducted
      in the summer of 1972, many persons stated that although their parents or
      grandparents had been speakers of Ojibwa or Assiniboine or French, they
      became speakers of Michif. The ex&shy;tent of this shift needs further
      documentation; the explanation of contributing causes is complex.</span

  <p class="c106">
    <span class="c2"
      >This dictionary is essentially the work of two people: Patline Laverdure
      and Ida Rose Allard, with editorial assistance from myself. Many others
      con&shy;tributed: in a sense the whole reservation, because it provided
      the context in which the use of Michif has prospered. Many individuals
      have contributed more directly, as friends and advisors of the authors. Of
      special importance are other persons who have been involved in efforts to
      preserve language and culture on the reservation. Institutionally the
      primary and sustaining force has come from the Turtle Mountain Community
      College, with assistance from the U.S. Department of Education and the
      U.S. Department of the Interior, and special credit is due to President
      Gerald Monette for his dedication and perseverance in providing the means
      for the dictionary to be completed. The University of North Dakota,
      through the partial provision of my services as editor, through a Faculty
      Research Grant and a Summer </span
    ><span class="c31"
      >Research Professor&shy;ship, has also made a contribution.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c76">
    <span class="c2"
      >The selection of entries for the dictionary was made by the authors. All
      en&shy;tries, with the exception of a very few provided by myself, were
      made by them, recorded on 4 x 6 cards with an illustrative sentence for
      each Michif equivalent to the English entry. Each card was checked at
      least once by both the authors and almost all by myself. These materials
      were then edited and entered into a Compugraphic 7500 editing
      system.</span

  </p>
  <p class="c112">
    <span class="c2"
      >The strengths of this work derive from the authenticity of its
      authorship. The fact that they selected and produced the material makes it
      largely ap&shy;propriate and natural. The illustrative sentences provide a
      great deal of infor&shy;mation about local customs and beliefs. The
      illustrations themselves are also a strength, since they show quite
      clearly and at considerable volume, how French and Cree elements combine
      and alternate in the language and should therefore be useful for students
      of language. For many entries, speakers seem to have a choice between an
      expression which is largely Cree and another which may be partly or
      largely, sometimes completely French.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c103">
    <span class="c2"
      >It was not the hope nor less the intention of this project to provide a
      com&shy;plete picture of the Michif language. It was hoped that it would
      provide enough information to serve as a useful focal point for further
      discussion, and ideally would lead to a continuing collection of
      additional dialectic material as well as to necessary corrections to the
      items reported. The illustrative sentences should be a decided plus in
      this process.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p class="c113">
    <span class="c2"
      >The work is intended primarily for speakers of the language and their
      children. We hope that it will help to provide a feeling of pride of
      identity to Metis people in general and to the members of the Turtle
      Mountain Chippewa in particular. It is also hoped that it will become part
      of a much more extensive program for language preservation, including the
      preparation and employ&shy;ment of language lesson materials for a wide
      range of age groups, along with literary, cultural, and practical
      materials for reading, and concerted efforts to make the language a more
      noticeable and visible presence on the reservation. It should also be of
      some value to the academic and scholarly community, especially in the
      light of the growing interest in products of language contact, and the
      relative paucity of other treatments of Michif. If the interest in this
      dictionary turns out to be sufficient to lead to its correction and
      amplification, that would be a more than gratifying response to the hopes
      of its preparers.</span
